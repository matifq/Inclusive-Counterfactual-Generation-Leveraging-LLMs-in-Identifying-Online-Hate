Secondly, she was born in Norway to an Afghan mother and a Pakistani father. This therefore doesn't make her Norwegian, however, the media likes to make her out to be Norwegian / British.

It is clear, above all else that her career is being funded by individuals. You don't get into media unless you're working for certain groups and her documentary on 'neo nazis' in Charlotsville (White Right: Meeting the Enemy) scooped many awards, all, broadly supported by media outlets. And this is what angers me about people like Khan. She's clearly a racist and has negative views towards people of different races and I am deeply sad what has happened to Afghanistan, but either is she completely ignorant on the fact that certain groups were involved in conflicts and pretty much have influence in some governments, as they do most. As stated, her video was a demonization of people of different races, who love their culture and nation and this is precisely what certain groups love doing most - funding projects, to make biased documentaries, whom they then classify as British, while showing these documentaries on TV, in order to create more divisions and promote multiculturalism. Stupid people won't see what's going on, but then they never see what's going on, so no change there.

Since it would be too expensive to assume dumping the solution off airplanes onto entire cities would be even remotely fiscally responsible given the struggles to procure wealth as they have always shown, it would be an act of humanitarian charity to put these communities into a sort of vapour delivery room and then have the solution pumped in through the vents. It would enter the room, that would act as a chamber of sorts, via a gaslike transmission method and be collected by the nasal passages of these communities.

Many tend to push their children into the field of medicine, overlooking the importance and potential of careers in entrepreneurial business, law, politics, and technology. The underlying reason for this is the desire for prestige that comes with having a child who is a doctor. They often dismiss any arguments about the limited number of positions available in medicine and blame the child for not getting in. Consequently, those children who are not accepted into medical school end up with a degree that may not lead to well-paying jobs, such as research, or may pursue other paths for lesser pay. Asian parents should also focus on teaching their children to start businesses, work hard, and pursue a vocation where they can truly make an impact, rather than solely pursuing what makes the parents look good.",
