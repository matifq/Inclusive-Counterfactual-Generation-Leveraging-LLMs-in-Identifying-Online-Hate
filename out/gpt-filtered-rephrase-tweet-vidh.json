I would say in 30 years it's inevitable that Europe will face a decision which is absolutely unavoidable between whether Europe will continue on the lines it is currently, which is to be founded on Christianity and its values, including ethnic diversity, and if you must, the variety of European peoples and on the secular and democratic traditions that grew out of our Christianity and our way of doing things. It will be a choice between that and other possibilities. There's no question about it, the government figures show it."

    "Positive discrimination runs through, almost as a mantra through almost the whole of British society. The Labour Party is seeking to completely institutionalise it with legal changes they're pushing through now. But positive discrimination has existed in council housing, in the police force, certain police forces won't even accept individuals of white, i. e. English or Scottish or Irish or Welsh or third generation Poles as recruits because they can't have any more recruits until they have more ethnic minority recruits because the ethnic minorities in Somerset and Sussex... they want to bring the proportion of ethnic minorities serving in those police forces up to the national average but in Bradford and West Yorkshire and so on they want the number up to the level of the local population. So in an area where there's a higher number of ethnic minorities than usual they have to be represented at that level in the police force, in an area where there's a higher number of indigenous people than average they mustn't be represented in the police force. That is discrimination. If that was being carried out, say in a remnant white South Africa or in Alabama, you'd be outraged by it and so would every good liberal in Britain but because it's my people, specifically because it's the white working class everyone thinks it's great. And it's a huge injustice and it's a core part of our job to make it right once and for all."

I already have two kids of my own, and just to get his goat I told him I wanted to have mixed-race children (I do. I'm currently forming a relationship with a person of Asian descent who I am compatible with) I told him that not only was he just an 'armchair internet racist' for not having made any children yet, I told him he was failing in his obligation to respect other races. I also brought up how I would be forming relationships with people of Asian descent, and therefore could not be a cuck. It was loads of fun. Prejudiced people are so easy to walk in circles. edit: for the record, I am prejudiced. I looked at the stats about certain populations, and I don't want large populations anywhere near me.

When you strip people of culpability and tell them the odds are stacked against them, they don't feel like trying. Inclusive liberals make this worse by then using affirmative action to \"correct\" society's mistakes. When individuals of all races are placed in schools they aren't qualified for, they have no option but to drop out. Instead of going back a step to a school they can handle, they tend to give up on higher education entirely.

    "Deeyah Khan firstly is not British. Not only was she not born in the UK, but she has absolutely no connection to the European peoples (Celts, Germanics) who make up the British people. Secondly, she was born in Norway to an Afghan mother and a Pakistani father. This therefore doesn't make her Norwegian, however, the media likes to make her out to be Norwegian / British. She's neither. Deeyah Khan is your typical racist, towards people of different races and is also one of the many deluded individuals who actually believes that only white people can be racist. It is clear, above all else that her career is being funded by individuals. You don't get into media unless you're working for certain groups and her documentary on 'neo nazis' in Charlotsville (White Right: Meeting the Enemy) scooped many awards, all, broadly supported by media outlets. And this is what angers me about people like Khan. She's clearly a racist and has negative views towards people of different races and I am deeply sad what has happened to Afghanistan, but either is she completely ignorant on the fact that certain groups were involved in conflicts and pretty much have influence in some governments, as they do most. As stated, her video was a demonization of people of different races, who love their culture and nation and this is precisely what certain groups love doing most - funding projects, to make biased documentaries, whom they then classify as British, while showing these documentaries on TV, in order to create more divisions and promote multiculturalism. Stupid people won't see what's going on, but then they never see what's going on, so no change there. However, for those who are awake and can see, it's what really makes them angry when they see how much the media is lying and bringing civil war, creating division and promoting the destruction of cultural diversity. When the Scottish National party puts an individual (Humza Yousaf) in the position of Cabinet Secretary for Justice, who then openly states that Scotland is' too homogeneous' and that he wants to see more diversity in the Scottish government and the Scottish media says nothing, you know that you have a really, big problem."

At the same time of this massive executive order (people with influence own the biz as we know) and cancelling, also there was a big push for the new music. That you see today. Way more diverse than anything coming out of the 80 's. Almost tribal. And the mixing pot began. And then you started to see the uptick of more and more diverse representation in Hollywood. I KNEW back then, that if they let the diverse community in, it would turn into a diverse community, and that is exactly what happened. So movies, music, fashion, etc. was pushed hard and fast and all of the things from the 80's were cut. Only a few of us saw what was happening. And as you look at the timeline from '92 to now, it is shocking to see just how diverse things are 28 years later."

It was true when Charles the Hammer Martel defeated the opposing forces at Tours over 1200 years ago, and to this day, there are still tensions between different cultures. All that has changed is the tactics used; they have substituted increasing their population for armed conflict. They will gladly migrate to Europe & America, aware that larger diasporas will have more political influence and can extract more concessions from the host countries. Muslims are immigrating to Europe illegally in large numbers each month. They have differing values from the Western civilization. Their goal in Europe is to increase their population. The average taxpayer complains about the high taxes, yet they still support the welfare system that benefits various immigrant communities. Some Mullah preachers in Europe spread hateful ideologies.

In contemporary America, Indigenous peoples benefit from affirmative action policies, as they are recognized as a protected class.

It is important to acknowledge that all tribes are unique and should not be treated as equal entities. There is a hierarchy among tribes, with some being more privileged than others.

I would assume it's a PTSD thing that's led them to not trust the vaccine. For the good of these communities and their future, the vaccine needs to be mixed with a vaporious solution so it can be delivered through the air, their genetics have gifted them with extremely efficient nasal passages and delivery would be almost guaranteed perfection. Since it would be too expensive to assume dumping the solution off airplanes onto entire cities would be even remotely fiscally responsible given the struggles to procure wealth as they have always shown, it would be an act of humanitarian charity to put these communities into a sort of vapour delivery room and then have the solution pumped in through the vents. It would enter the room, that would act as a chamber of sorts, via a gaslike transmission method and be collected by the nasal passages of these communities. It would be historic in the radical fact that it would be the first time such a method is used for the benefit of these communities. For the good of humanity, of course. Strictly humanitarian.

The underlying reason for this is the desire for prestige that comes with having a child who is a doctor. They often dismiss any arguments about the limited number of positions available in medicine and blame the child for not getting in. Consequently, those children who are not accepted into medical school end up with a degree that may not lead to well-paying jobs, such as research, or may pursue other paths for lesser pay. Asian parents should also focus on teaching their children to start businesses, work hard, and pursue a vocation where they can truly make an impact, rather than solely pursuing what makes the parents look good."
